# ProTV Asset Changelog

## 2.2 Stable Release
- Version bump for release

## 2.2 Beta 3.1
- Add Playlist option for specifying if autoplay should start running on load or wait until interaction: `Autoplay On Load`
- Add Playlist option for specifying if autoplay should make the playlist restart if it reaches the end: `Loop Playlist`

## 2.2 Beta 3.0
- Fix inconsistent animations on the UI for ProTV Composite
- Add descripive text to CompositeUI detailing how to interact with the visibility
- Add an udon graph compatible `_Switch` event for the playlist, utilizing new variable `SWITCH_TO_INDEX`
- Update Resync (Micro) to use the correct icon
- Add optional buffer time for allowing a video to pre-load before playing
- Fix MediaControls info data not being updated at all the points it was supposed to
- Fix owner reloading not doing proper jumpTime to the active timestamp (aka lossless owner video reload)
- Fix skybox settings UI interactions not working as expected
- Fix video player selection sync being improperly implemented
- Updated documentation for new changes

## 2.2 Beta 2.1
- Attempts at fixing Unity being absolutlely insufferable with broken references
- Adjust GeneralQueue so that there isn't any conflicting sync types

## 2.2 Beta 2.0
- Udpate logic for handling consistent setup of the canvas colliders.
    - If you have your own UI or you unpacked a prefab, you will need to add the new script `ProTV/Scripts/UiShapeFixes` to any canvas gameobject with a `VRCUiShape` component on it. If you are using the prefabs, they should automatically update with the new script.
- Remove some udon overhead by switching some scripts to None sync type.
- Add optional toggle for syncing the current video player selection.

## 2.2 Beta 1.1
- Add functionality to MediaControls url inputs to be able to submit the URL upon pressing enter.

## 2.2 Beta 1.0
- Add new Misc folder and new prefab "PlaylistQueueDrawer". Contains new visuals for playlist and queue in a drawer like layout.
- Add new MediaControls prefab "DrawerControls".
- Add new TV Prefab "ProTV Composite". Contains both "DrawerControls" and "PlaylistQueueDrawer" prefabs.
- Add configurable player-specific limit value to the Queue plugin.
- Fix Queue plugin causing videos to abruptly stop when certain players leave the world.
- Update Queue to utilize array sync for urls (since VRChat recently added support for that).
- Fix looping via play button after video ends causing extraneous events to trigger that shouldn't.
- Fix race condition with seeking where it wouldn't always seek to the desired time depending on when the seek is requested.
- Update URL resolver shim to look for the new ytdlp executable.
- Update playlist init code to prefer the TV's autoplay url field over its own list.
- Add support for changing and shifting priorities for event subscribers.
	- First (before all other priorities)
	- High (first of its current priority)
	- Low (last of its current priority)
	- Last (after all other priorities)
- Add udon events for interacting with the new priority shifting mechanism.
- Add playlist integration with priority shifting. This allows for a playlist to prioritize itself when interacted with. Set the new `Prioritize on interact` flag under the autoplay section of the playlist script to enable.

## 2.1 Stable Release
- Version bump for release

## 2.1 Beta 3.0
- Updated VideoManger to have separate lists for managed and unmanaged speakers and screens.
    - This is intended to allow for more fine grained control of what the video managers should actually affect.
    - Immediate use case is for dealing with audio link speakers(they are typically at 0.001) that you don't want the volume changed on, but still want to have the TV control the auible speakers' volume.
- Removed the autoManageScreenVisibility flag.
    - With the new Unmanaged Screens list, this flag is duplicated functionality.
- Updated example scene to reflect these changes.

NOTE: Existing TV setups should still work as expected after importing. There is fallback logic that exists for handling the previous references that Unity already has serialized. The only exception is if you set the autoManageScreenVisibiliy flag to prevent the VideoManager from controlling the referenced screens. To fix, you will need to add that screen to the Unmanaged Screens list for the same behaviour.

## 2.1 Beta 2.9
- Add additional null check for the Queue plugin to remove unintended error occuring in non-cyanemu playmode (like build & publish)

## 2.1 Beta 2.8
- Fix playlist unintentionally scrolling when contained within a pickup object (something that moves the playlist's world postition)
- Adjustments to the Modern Model and Legacy Model prefabs for the options available. This clarifies some options as well as includes a default Unity player option in the general controls options list. Legacy Model Extended still retains the original list from the example scene.
- Fix timestamp not being preserved as it used to during a video player swap.

## 2.1 Beta 2.7
- Add null checks to remove unintended errors occuring in non-cyanemu playmode (like build & publish)

## 2.1 Beta 2.6
- Add null check to the video swap dropdown layering check incase the dropdown isn't a direct child of it's associated canvas object. This avoids an incedental script crash, but can cause odd layering issue if it's not a direct child, so be careful.

## 2.1 Beta 2.5
- Fix bad execution ordering between TVManagerV2 and TVManagerV2ManualSync scripts
- Add events on the playlist to manage the autoplay mode

## 2.1 Beta 2.4
- Fix layering issues and pointer issues with the general controls video swap dropdown

## 2.1 Beta 2.3
- Add explicit Refresh button to the slim UI prefab.
- Updated the icon for the Resync button on the slim UI prefab to be distinct from the Refresh button.
- Add new VertControls UI prefab. Similar to Slim UI, but layout is vertical with some elements removed.
- Remove forced canvas sort order for controls UIs.

## 2.1 Beta 2.2
- Fix playlist not updating the TV's localLabel on non-owners
- Fix attempt for videos having issues with looping (stutter and occasionally unexpected pausing)
- Minor performance improvment to the playlist editor script
- Fix playlist producing null titles instead of empty strings causing the search feature to fail
- Add warning message when a playlist import detects one or more entries that do not have a title associated with it. This is just an alert and can be ignored if the missing titles are intentional.

## 2.1 Beta 2.1
- Change `useAlternateUrl` to be not exposed to the inspector. It is still a public variable for runtime though.
- Change url logic to have quest default to the alternate, with fallback to main url when alternate is not provided (this allows seemless backwards compatibility)

## 2.1 Beta 2.0
- Add first class support for alternate urls. This alleviates issues with requiring separate URLs for each platform (notably VRCDN)
- Fix playlist not always correctly representing the loading bar percent while scrolling.
- Add toggle prefab to allow switching between Main and Alt urls. This is _HIGHLY_ recommended to have in-world if you make use of
the alternate url feature.
- New events related to alternate urls: `_UseMainUrl`, `_UseAltUrl`, `_ToggleUrl`
- BE SURE TO CHECK YOUR SCENE REFERENCES TO ENSURE THEY ARE CONNECTED PROPERLY. Some variable names changed related to urls and certain references _may_ have become disconnected.
- Fix certain issues with the skybox playlist not working properly.
- Update `PlayURL (Micro)` prefab to support alternate url. Great for predetermined stream splitting.

## 2.1 Beta 1.1
- Additional internal state caching improvements for playlist
- Add playlist shuffling via `_Shuffle` event.
- Add option to automaticially shuffle the playlist on world load (currently not synced).
- Add option to start autoplaying at a random index in the playlist.
- Add playlist view automatically seeking to the current index on world load (complements the random index start).
- Some code golfing micro-optimizations

## 2.1 Beta 1.0
- Improve some internal state caching for playlist
- Add playlist pagination prefab.
- Fix scrollbar not resizing with the playlist when a filter is applied (aka playlist search)
- Add U#'s URL Resolver shim for playmode testing with the unity player (AVPro still doesn't work in-editor yet)

## 2.0 Stable Release
- Version bump for release

## 2.0 Beta 8.5
- Update automatic resync interval to Infinity if value is 0 (both values should represent the same effect).
- Mitigations for when the TV starts off in the world as disabled. Should be able to just toggle the game object at will, though if you want the TV to start off as disabled, make sure the game object itself is off instead of relying on other scripts to toggle it off for you (like a toggle script). There is a known bug with having it on and disabling it during Start. See and upvote: https://feedback.vrchat.com/vrchat-udon-closed-alpha-bugs/p/1123-udon-objects-with-udon-children-initialize-late-despite-execution-order-ove
- Forcefully disable the built-in auto-resync cause it breaks things reeeee
- Improve the skybox options in the demo scene.
- Rename Plugins folder to OfficialPlugins.
- Update playlist structure and logic for vastly improved performance at larger list sizes.

## 2.0 Beta 8.4
- Fixed entry placement regression in playlist auto-grid.
- Add skybox support for CubeMap style 360 video.
- Add skybox support for 3D video modes SideBySide and OverUnder.
- Add skybox support for brightness control.
- Add settings UI to the skybox TV prefab.
- Updated demo scene with new skybox data.
- Add custom meta support for the URLs. 
    - Can now specify custom data that is arbitrarily stored in the TV in the `string[] urlMeta` variable.
    - All meta entries are separated by a `;` and proceeds a hash (`#`) in the URL.
    - Example: With a url like `https://vimeo.com/207571146#Panoramic;OverUnder`, the `urlMeta` field will contain both `"Panoramic"` and `"OverUnder"`.
    - This meta portion of the URL can be used for pretty much anything as anything as the hash of a URL is ignored by servers. Use it to store information about any particular individual url (such as what skybox modes to apply).

## 2.0 Beta 8.3
- Fixed playlist auto-grid being limited to 255 rows or columns. Should be able to have many more than that now.
- Fixed playlist in-game performance issues by swapping from game object toggling to canvas component toggling.
    - This specifically fixes lag issue when desiring to hide the playlist.   
    While game object toggling is still supported, this new mode is highly recommended. Is utilized by calling `playlist -> _Enable/_Disable/_Toggle` events.
    - Playlist Search also makes use of this performance improvements by having a canvas component on the template root object (and thus on every playlist entry object).

## 2.0 Beta 8.2
- Cleaned up names of prefabs a bit (no breaking changes)
- Exported with 2019 LTS
- Added KoFi support links to the Docs. Support is inifinitely appreciated!
- Added Micro style controls to the MediaControls plugin.
- Added a one-off play url button control to the MediaControls plugin. This has definitely been requested quite a bit.

## 2.0 Beta 8.1
- Added better support for plugins being disabled by default getting enabled after the world load phase.
    - This guarantees that AT LEAST the `_TvReady` event will _ALWAYS_ be the first event called on a subscribed behavior.
- Fixed support for start/end time usage. 
    - Adds script variable `videoLength` to represent the full length of the backing video, where `videoDuration` now represents the amount of time between the start and end time of a video.
- Update Controls script to utilize the new usage of `videoDuration` and to properly display when the time is less than start time (for example if the AVPro buffer bug prevents the complete auto-seek that is expected, it will have the current time be a negative value)
- Add playlist search toggle for skipping playlists who's gameobject is disabled.  
- Change default automatic resync interval to 5 minutes.  
- Fixed initial volume not being assigned properly during the Start phase.
- Update VideoManagerV2 to rework the configuration options to have clearer names as well as more precise purpose.  


## 2.0 Beta 8.0
- Fixed playlist performance issues. 
- Added pagination to the playlist inspector for easier navigation.
- Playlist titles are now no longer limited to 140 characters
- Added playlist search prefab (part of the Playlist plugin system)
    - PROTIP: To add extra text to search by in a title, you can set the text size to any part of the title to 0  
    Such as: `Epic Meme Compilation #420 <size=0>2008 2012 ancient throwback classic </size>`
- Final reorganization of folder structure.
    - The root folder has been renamed from `TV` to `ProTV`
    - Updated documentation to reflect the update folder structure.
    - Anything that used to be in the `TV/Scripts/Plugins` folder is in their respective `ProTV/Plugins/*` folders.
    - All plugin specific files have been moved to the plugin specific folders (eg: `TV/Stuff/UI` -> `ProTv/Plugins/MediaControls/UI`)
    - The base `Stuff` folder has been removed in favor of individual folders.
- Finally remove the ProTV v1 TVManager and VideoManager (the legacy ones that should no longer be in use anyways)
- Fixed the MediaControls dropdown nested canvas issue (the one where the cursor hid parts of the menu)
- Add configuration options to `VideoManagerV2` for defining how the audio is handled during video player swap.
- Add missing and cleanup existing documentation.
- Fix improper queue behavior when the TV is in a locked state.

#### Known Issues
- If the owner has a video paused and a late joiner joins, the video won't be paused for them, it'll still play.
- (AVPro issue) Unable to seek to any point in the video until the download buffer (internal to AVPro) has reached that point.
- When testing locally, it is recommended NOT to disable the `Allow Master Control`. Due to an issue with how instance owner works locally, you will get locked out of the TV if you have `Locked By Default` enabled. This issue is NOT present once uploaded to VRChat servers, and can be safely disabled prior to uploading if the feature is needed.
- (*WHEN UPGRADING FROM BETA 6.8 OR PRIOR*) To complete the upgrade, you need to manually rename the file `SimplePlaylist.cs` to  `Playlist.cs`, which was located at `Assets/ArchiTechAnon/TV/Scripts/Plugins`, because unity hates file name changes apparently.
- (*WHEN UPGRADING FROM BETA 7.1 OR EARLIER*) If you have any playlists in your scene you will need to click the "Update Scene" button on each of them to regenerate the scene structure for the new click detection required for uncapped playlist entry count.

## 2.0 Beta 7.1
- Added a configurable auto resync interval that will trigger a resync for both Audio/Video and time sync between users. 
    - This helps ensure tight and accurate playback between all users, even in certain low performance situations.
- Removed the `Playing Threshold` configuration option as it's no longer used.
- Create folder `Assets/ArchiTechAnon/TV/Plugins` as the location for all plugin specific things to be moved to prior to official release.
- Updated 360 video from a sphere mesh to a new custom skybox swap mechanism.  
This is available as a prefab in `Assets/ArchiTechAnon/TV/Plugins/SkyboxSwapper`
- Fix improper implementation of _ChangeSeek* methods.
    - `_ChangeSeekTime` and `_ChangeSeekTimeTo(float)` now operate with an explicit time in seconds.  
    It uses the variable `IN_ChangeSeekTo_float_Seconds`.
    - Added `_ChangeSeekPercent` and `_ChangeSeekPercentTo(float)` to operate with a normalized percent value between 0.0 and 1.0.  
    It uses the variable `IN_ChangeSeekPercent_float_Percent`.
    It automatically takes into consideration any custom start and end time given via query parameters. 

## 2.0 Beta 7.0
- Add new Queue plugin.
- Fix various stability issues with live streams
- Aspect-Ratio now renders correctly (Thanks Merlin & Texelsaur!)
- Image support and Auto-Grid support added to the playlist plugin
- Example of a 360 video usage added to the demo scene.
- Mitigated race condition for owner vs other when loading media.
- Corrected the implementation of the MediaChange event to occur at the correct times.
- Fix some edge-case issues with autoplay.
- Added mitigations for certain audio/video desync issues.
- All TV events have been renamed from using the `_On` prefix to using the `_Tv` prefix to avoid naming confusion with normal udon events.
    - Example: `_OnPlay` would be `_TvPlay` and `_OnMediaStart` is now `_TvMediaStart`
    - NOTE: The outgoing variable names have also been updated respectively. Example: `OUT_OnOwnerChange_int_Id` is now `OUT_TvOwnerChange_int_Id`
- Simplified extension script and plugin names
    - `SimplePlaylist` is now just `Playlist`
    - Previously mentioned `LiveQueue` (new in this release) is going to be called simply `Queue` 
- Renamed `allowMasterLockToggle` flag on `TVManagerV2` to `allowMasterControl` for clarity on how the flag is actually used.

#### Known issues
- If TV owner has the player paused, late joiners will still play the video on join until a sync check occurs (play/pause/stop/seek/etc).

## 2.0 Beta 6
- Update sync data to take advantage of the Udon Network Update (UNU) changes
- Move all occasional data into manually synced variables
- Add network lag compensation logic to improve sync time accuracy
- Remove the playerId value from the info display text
- `BasicUI.cs` and `SlimUI.cs` have been merged into a single plugin `UnifiedControls_ActiveState.cs`
- Many refinements to the controls UI plugin
- Remove loop buttons; looping is now controlled exclusively by the loop url parameter
- Add Resync UI action for triggering the sync enforcement for one frame (in case the video sync drifts)
- Add Reload UI action for explicitly doing a media reload with a single click (just does _Stop then _Play behind the scenes)
- Adjusted some UI layout parameters for better structure
- `BasicUI` plugin has been rebuilt as the `GeneralControls` plugin
- `SlimUI` plugin has been rebuilt as the `SlimControls` plugin
- `SlimUIReduced` plugin has been rebuilt as the `MinifiedControls` plugin
- Updated the example scene to account for the controls plugins changes
- Update playlist inspector to accept pulling playlist info from a custom txt file


## 2.0 Beta 5
- Modify how time sync works. It now only enforces sync time from owner for the first few seconds, and then any time a state change of the TV affects the current sync time. Basically, the enforcement is a bit more lax to help support Quest playback better.
- Update the UIs to make use of the modified sync time activity. Sync button is now an actual "Resync" action, that will do a one-time activation of the sync time enforcement which will jump the video to the current time sync from the owner.
- Start using a formal CHANGELOG
